# PostCSS

  > A Dumb Name For an Awesome Thing

CSS preprocessors have revealed to front-end developers the shortcomings of CSS. But there was a catch: you had to choose your language and stick with it. Would you go Sass? Or try LESS? Was Stylus your flavor? PostCSS, built on Node, is a CSS transforming engine that lets you choose (and write) the plugins that you need (or want) to take your styling source files and turn them into CSS. It's fast; it's flexible; it's awesome.
